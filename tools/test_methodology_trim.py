"""Functional tests for starter-kit/methodology_trim.py — the ledger trimmer.

CANONICAL-ONLY. Not in bin/_manifest.py, so adopters do not receive it.

DISCIPLINE THIS FILE IS WRITTEN UNDER (design §11 Phase 1, and this repo's own learnings):

  * PROVE THE FIXTURE FIRST. A test green for a year can assert nothing about its stated case if
    its fixture was never that artifact. Every fixture here has an unmutated control that asserts
    what the fixture IS before anything is asserted about what the code does to it.
  * DRIVE EACH GUARD RED AND WATCH IT FAIL. Green is not evidence until red has been observed.
  * NARROW THE GUARD, DO NOT ONLY DELETE IT. Deleting a guard proves only that it runs. Each
    assertion below also has a NARROWED variant — the plausible weaker implementation — shown to
    PASS the case the full-strength guard catches. That is what makes the strong clause load-bearing.
  * ASSERT ON NAMED FINDINGS, NEVER ON THE EXIT CODE. The exit code is a union over every check
    the tool runs, so adding a check silently re-labels unrelated assertions (design §6.3).

TWO FIXTURES ARE REAL HISTORY, NOT INVENTED — both events happened in this repository:
  L2  `020ba3f^:CHANGELOG.md` — the last tree in which the root ledger still had its pre-v3.0
      scope footer. The commit that archived from it lost that footer, and it is still missing.
  L3  `7a71df0` — the archive that moved 19 receipts AND rewrote the RETAINED S22 receipt in the
      same commit, making "the move was verbatim" unfalsifiable.

# SYNTHETIC FIXTURES — portable stand-ins for this repository's own archive events.
#
# UPSTREAM PORT. L1/L2/L3 were originally driven by two commits in the canonical fork's history:
# `020ba3f`, a CHANGELOG archive that carried the scope footer out of the live file, and
# `7a71df0`, a HANDOFFS archive that bundled a record edit with the move. Neither is reachable in
# any other clone, so the whole L-series could only run in one repository — including for an
# adopter who installs the trimmer and wants to know it works.
#
# These reproduce the STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES those events supplied, never their bytes:
#   * SYNTHETIC_CHANGELOG — front matter, records, and a NON-EMPTY footer carrying a rebasable
#     `](link)`. The link is load-bearing: it is what makes the footer-moved clause detectable
#     through `transform_record`, and a footer without one silently weakens that test.
#   * SYNTHETIC_BEFORE / _AFTER / _SHARD — a 25 = 6 + 19 partition in which one RETAINED record
#     was edited. Counts partition; content does not. That is precisely what made `7a71df0` the
#     event worth testing against.
#
# The original docstrings warned that "a synthetic one tests the test". That warning is ANSWERED,
# not waved away, by TestSyntheticFixtureControls below: it proves each fixture actually carries
# the property the tests rely on, and that the assertions still go RED against it. A fixture
# nobody has driven red is not a fixture.

# ⚠ `body` GREW 3,500 -> 7,000 AT PHASE C2, AND THE REASON IS NOT COSMETIC. These fixtures must be
# large enough to FIRE the shipped trigger, and C2 raised it from 65,536 B to 196,608 B. At the old
# size make_repo() produced ~108 KB, which fired the old byte arm and is silent under the new one:
# 22 tests in this file went red as [NOTHING_TO_DO], every one of them about shard mechanics, SRF,
# or losslessness rather than about calibration.
#
# THE ALTERNATIVE WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED, recorded so it is not re-litigated: passing
# `--budget-bytes 65536` at each call site would have held every downstream number byte-identical
# and made these tests immune to future recalibration. It was rejected because it would leave the
# SHIPPED configuration unexercised end-to-end — every trim in this file would run at a budget no
# adopter has — which is the "a guard you can walk around by picking a parameter" shape this repo
# already has a learning about. Growing the fixture keeps the default on the tested path.
#
# Measured after the change: 123 tests pass, and the fixture is NON-VACUOUS — make_repo() yields
# 213,704 B against a 196,608 B trigger, --check reports FIRES, and a real --write lands at
# 93,909 B, inside (READ_CAP_BYTES, CLASS_A_STOP_BYTES]. Retained-record counts moved 9 -> 13; no

# BL-36 — the generated proof's INJECTED constant is a 0/1 FLAG, not a count of what the trim
# commit actually added, so `ar_cmp = ar[INJ:]` skips the wrong number of records and the whole
# positional comparison shifts. Any trim commit bundled with a second entry to the same ledger
# fails BY CONSTRUCTION, with zero data loss. Observed on this repo's own shipped artifacts:
# `CHANGELOG-through-2026-08-02` (commit added 2, INJECTED=1) reports `L3 record count 73 != 72`
# and `CHANGELOG-through-2026-08-09` (added 3) reports `77 != 75`, while S88's independent
# identity-keyed re-derivation measured 0 records missing at either trim
# (docs/audits/2026-08-15-bl36-archive-losslessness.md, Findings #1 and #2).
#
# THE REPAIR IS TO MEASURE THE INJECTED SET BY CONTENT, NOT TO RE-PARAMETERIZE THE POSITION.
# L1/L2/L3 keep their exact semantics: the records the COMMIT introduced are those present in
# `after ∪ shard` and absent from `before`, computed from record text and removed occurrence-wise
# before the byte-for-byte comparison runs. That is not circular — it is a different function of
# the same three artifacts, never the difference L1/L3 are about to assert on (Learning #16).
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not make a record EDITED inside the trim commit
# pass. Such a record's pre-trim bytes exist nowhere afterwards, so it is genuinely not preserved
# and BL-27's "stays a loud FAIL" is correct — see TestVerifyShHandoffFalsePositives above, which
# must stay green. Only ADDITIONS become tolerable, because an added record makes no claim about
# a record that was already there.

# =============================================================================================
# GRAMMAR_MISMATCH — a file the grammar cannot read must not be reported as a file with nothing
# in it. UAT finding F1 (docs/planning/uat-2026-08-04-six-adopters.md §4).
#
# The defect these pin: evaluate() answered `[NO_RECORDS] ... nothing to archive. (A freshly
# seeded ledger looks exactly like this, and must not be trimmed.)` AT EXIT 0 for a 597,717 B
# ledger holding 130 dated entries and a 1,239,085 B ledger keying entries on table rows, because
# neither
# uses the declared `### YYYY-MM-DD · [tag]` heading. A 1.2 MB ledger and a 324 B fresh seed
# produced byte-identical output and the same exit status, and the message actively reassured.
#
# EVERY FIXTURE HERE IS A LITERAL, ON PURPOSE. The shapes are copied from real adopter ledgers
# and each one's real-world source and measurements are named in its docstring, but no test reads
# a sibling repository: a suite that does is green or red depending on which checkouts happen to
# sit beside this one, which is not a property of this code. The two seed fixtures come from
# `show("HEAD:...")`, not from the working tree — a working-tree read measures a file nobody
# shipped, and during the design review for this very change an agent left an uncommitted edit in
# `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md` that would have silently redefined the control.
#
# ON ASSERTING `Result.exit` HERE. This file's own rule is "assert on named findings, never on
# the exit code," and design §6.3 states its reason: the exit code "is a union over every check
# the tool runs." That union is `main()`'s `worst = max(...)` across `--file` arguments
# (methodology_trim.py:1629-1635). `Result.exit` is per-evaluation, and in this branch evaluate()
# returns immediately, so the union is over exactly one check — which each test asserts by
# checking `len(r.codes) == 1` beside it. The exit status is pinned because it is half of what
# F1 reports: a mutant that keeps the code and drops `exit_code=3` produces identical `codes`,
# and asserting codes alone lets exactly the reported defect back in.
