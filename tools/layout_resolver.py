"""The layout resolver: where do a project's methodology files live? (BL-101, phase P1.)

CANONICAL-ONLY reference copy. Contract: docs/planning/methodology-subdirectory-plan.md
section 4.3. A project keeps its methodology files either at its root (legacy) or one level
down in methodology/ (new). The answer is read from one anchor file, by the four-row table:

    R/methodology/<anchor>   R/<anchor>   kind      directory
    exists                   absent       new       R/methodology
    absent                   exists       legacy    R
    exists                   exists       half      None  -- stop, name both, never guess
    absent                   absent       none      None  -- the framework repo, or not an adopter

The anchor is the caller's choice, because a project can be part-way: the plan's tier 1 moves the
framework files (SESSION_RUNNER.md and the rest) and leaves the state files (CHANGELOG.md,
HANDOFFS.md, the two JSON configs) at the root until tier 2. A tool that reads a framework file
resolves with the default anchor; a tool that reads the ledger resolves with "CHANGELOG.md".
Resolving the ledger through the runner would point the ledger hook at a file that is not there,
which is the failure the plan's C5 measured: a gate that passes silently.

Shipped tools are single stdlib files adopters receive one by one, so none can import this module.
Each carries the marked block below, byte for byte, and its suite asserts that with
``embedded_block`` (the dashboard's twin test is the precedent). Everything between the markers
must run alone, importing only the standard library. This file is not in bin/_manifest.py.
