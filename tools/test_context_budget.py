"""Behaviour tests for starter-kit/context_budget.py — the FM #28 size-budget gate.

CANONICAL-ONLY. Not in bin/_manifest.py, so adopters do not receive it. The tool's own
`--selftest` ships to them and covers every pure gate; what cannot ship is this file's
git fixtures, which need a scratch repository with a real merge in it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Until BL-38 the tool's `calibrate()` had no test asserting
its arithmetic — Test 35 in bin/tests.sh covered install-hook, sync distribution and the
selftest gates, all of which stayed green while the fit itself returned noise on any repo
that had merged another lineage of its regressor. A shipped executable can be arbitrarily
wrong in a dimension nothing asserts. That is the same argument the harness already makes
for the ledger trimmer at bin/tests.sh:248-251.

DISCIPLINE THIS FILE IS WRITTEN UNDER (inherited from tools/test_methodology_trim.py):

  * PROVE THE FIXTURE FIRST. Every fixture asserts what it IS before anything is asserted
    about what the code does to it. A merge fixture that failed to create a merge would
    make the D1 tests pass for the wrong reason, forever.
  * DRIVE EACH GUARD RED. Green is not evidence until red has been observed. Each defect
    below is exhibited as well as fixed: D1 through `first_parent=False`, which is the
    real pre-change behaviour preserved as a parameter for exactly this purpose, and D2
    through `_string_size_at`, a verbatim re-implementation of the shipped comparison.
  * NARROW THE GUARD, DO NOT ONLY DELETE IT. The plausible weaker implementation is shown
    to give the WRONG answer on the same fixture, which is what makes the strong version
    load-bearing rather than merely present.
  * ASSERT ON VALUES, NEVER ON A TOOL'S EXIT CODE. An exit code is a union over every
    check the tool runs, so adding a check silently re-labels unrelated assertions.

THE PRE-CHANGE TOOL is blob be2721a5fa12df027636d1451d84301293467fae — `git cat-file blob
be2721a` — should anyone need to re-run the four-way fit that motivated this.
