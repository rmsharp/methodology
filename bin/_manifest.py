"""Distribution manifest — the single source of truth for what the methodology
ships into an adopter project, where each file lands, and how sync treats it.

Imported by bin/sync, bin/status, and bin/check-links so the mapping is defined
exactly once (B1 plan Decision 5; Ousterhout deepening — the three scripts
previously each carried their own copy of the file list).

Each entry is ``(src, dest, disposition)``:
  * ``src``         path relative to the canonical methodology repo root.
  * ``dest``        path relative to the ADOPTER project root (README Option B
                    layout: starter-kit root-files at the project root, the
                    framework under docs/methodology/). Cross-references inside
                    distributed files are authored for this layout — see
                    bin/check-links and B1 plan section 4 ("link-topology paradox").
  * ``disposition`` how sync reconciles the dest (see below).

Dispositions:
  TRACKED  canonical owns it; sync keeps it current and the existing
           drift / --force / upgrade machinery applies. Overwrites toward
           canonical (never silently clobbering unrecognized local edits).
  SEED     adopter owns it after first creation; sync writes it ONLY when the
           dest is absent and never overwrites it afterward (B1 plan Decision 2a).

Adopter-owned *instances* (CONTEXT.md, CLAUDE.md, BACKLOG.md, …) are deliberately
NOT listed: the template ships under a different name (CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md →
TRACKED), and the instance simply never appears as a dest, so it can never be a
sync target — no special-case guard needed (B1 plan Decision 2).

Python 3 stdlib only; data-only module (no imports, no side effects).

# Optional "current-format" markers for SEED dests, keyed by adopter-relative dest path.
#
# A SEED is adopter-owned and never overwritten (Decision 2a), so an adopter upgrading from an
# earlier methodology keeps its OLD-shaped seed: it gains the new behavior (the synced files) but
# silently misses the new seed FORMAT. When a seed listed here is PRESENT but its content lacks the
# marker string, bin/status reports it advisory-only as "present (stale format)" so the migration
# is DISCOVERABLE. sync still never auto-overwrites it — the adopter migrates it by hand
# (BOOTSTRAP.md "Updating an existing project…"; BL-6 item 2).
#
# A marker needs two properties:
#   1. LIFETIME-STABLE — it survives every prepend, trim and close-out, so an in-use current-format
#      seed is never mis-flagged. That rules out the METHODOLOGY-SEED-SENTINEL, which the adopter
#      deletes on its first real entry. A marker in the front matter survives, because
#      methodology_trim.py pins that zone and never archives it.
#   2. VERSION-DISCRIMINATING — absent from every earlier format it must detect, or it can never
#      fire. A marker keyed to something that never changes across versions, such as a title,
#      reports every old seed as current.
#
#   * CHANGELOG.md keys on "ledger-format: 2", on the seed's pointer to FRAMEWORK_APPARATUS.md
#     §The Action Ledger, which holds the rules the seed used to carry; the seed asks adopters to
#     keep that line. Bump the number whenever the seed's format changes again, and drive the stale
#     case in bin/tests.sh Test 20 red before trusting it — a marker that never moves never fires.
#   * HANDOFFS.md keys on "handoffs-format: 2", the first line of the seed's "Size, and when to
#     archive" section, so bringing that section across (the documented migration) carries it. It
#     used to key on the heading itself, which failed property 2: the seed that shipped with the
#     trimmer already had the heading, over the size premise this format replaced.
#   * SESSION_NOTES.md is deliberately omitted: it is rewritten wholesale every session, so no
#     token is stable enough to detect its format without false positives. Add an entry here only
#     when a seed gains a marker with both properties.
