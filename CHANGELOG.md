# Changelog — Authoritative Action Ledger

The cumulative, append-only record of **actions taken in this repository** — across backlog
items, repository issues, and ad-hoc work. It is the authoritative answer to *"what was done
here, ever?"*, distinct from the release narrative in [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning](CLAUDE.md#versioning).

This repository dogfoods its own methodology: every session records its actions here at
close-out (`starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 3F), and Phase 0 reconciles the ledger against
`git log` and backfills anything a crashed or out-of-band session missed. Taking an action — any
commit, or any non-commit action (release, tag, PR, upstream issue close, access grant, grooming
decision) — and not recording it is failure mode #27. The full close-out and reconcile rules, plus
the reusable seed, live in [`starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md`](starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md).

**Source tag — exactly one per entry**, so `grep -E '\[(issue #|BL-|ad hoc)' CHANGELOG.md`
enumerates every logged action and proves all three sources landed:

- `[issue #<N>]` — a repository issue. Issues for this repo live in the **upstream** parent
  `KJ5HST/methodology` (this fork has Issues disabled), so entries cite an **absolute URL**, never
  a bare `#<N>`.
- `[BL-<N>]` — a `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` item, removed from the backlog in the same commit.
- `[ad hoc]` — work with no backlog or issue origin: releases, tag/branch ops, PR opens, upstream
  issue closes, access grants, and decline/wontfix/grooming decisions.

**Boundary vs. `CLAUDE.md` §Versioning — so the two ledgers cannot diverge.** §Versioning owns
*released-version semantics* (one narrated entry per shipped version); `README.md` §What's New is
its public restatement. This ledger is the *per-action operational timeline*, including
non-release work (housekeeping, doc-only PRs, adopter coordination, backlog grooming) that
otherwise has no home but raw `git log`. Where the two overlap — a release — this ledger carries a
**one-line pointer** into §Versioning, never a re-narration (cite, don't restate).

Reverse-chronological, newest on top; prepend-only. Promote to `## YYYY-MM` sections as it grows.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] v3.2 shipped — PR #50 merged, tag + GitHub Release cut, fork synced
- **Change:** the BL-5 dashboard doc-only scoring change was designated **v3.2** (minor) and shipped.
  [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `9bda167`);
  the annotated tag `v3.2` was cut at that commit and its **GitHub Release published + marked Latest**;
  fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `df2cac9`, resolving one
  `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict, reconciled newest-on-top) and the tag mirrored to `origin`.
  `DASHBOARD_VERSION` is now 2.8.0; the failure-mode count stays 27.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) → merge `9bda167`; fork-sync
  merge `df2cac9`; this commit (fork `main` — BL-5 backlog close-out + these ledger entries). Release:
  <https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/releases/tag/v3.2>. → full narrative:
  [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.2"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** BL-5 deploy · **Verified:** v3.2 GitHub Release is Latest (`releases/latest` = v3.2);
  distributed files byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; fork `main` 0 behind upstream.

### 2026-07-08 · [BL-5] Dashboard doc-only scoring closed — removed from fork backlog
- **Change:** with v3.2 shipped, **BL-5** ("adapt dashboard scoring to document-only repositories",
  including the Signal-F adopter-gate + `starter-kit/__pycache__` polish notes) is complete and
  **removed from `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` "Open items"** (moved to the Completed table). The fork
  backlog now has one open item — **BL-6 items 2–3** (seed-format migration affordance;
  hook-distribution decision).
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`). The dashboard change itself shipped in
  [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) / v3.2 (see the entry above and the branch entry below).
- **Session:** BL-5 close-out · **Verified:** BL-5 no longer under "## Open items"; ledger source-tag census intact (`[issue #]` / `[BL-]` / `[ad hoc]` all present).

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Dashboard: fair scoring for document-only / research repos (DASHBOARD_VERSION 2.8.0)
- **Change:** `methodology_dashboard.py` (both byte-identical twins, `tools/` + `starter-kit/`) now
  detects a **document-only / research** repo and reshapes scoring so it is no longer falsely
  penalized for having nothing to unit-test. Detection is marker-override → source-loc cap (200) →
  corpus-disjunction: an explicit bidirectional **`.methodology-profile`** marker (`doc-only` |
  `code`) wins; otherwise a repo with negligible source but a real doc corpus **or** a render
  toolchain (the latter catches pure-LaTeX/Quarto repos whose `.tex`/`.qmd` aren't counted as docs)
  is doc-only. When doc-only, the 2nd health slot (dict key `testing`, stable for JSON/portfolio)
  is filled by a new **Render/Verification** score — an *honest static proxy* (the scanner cannot
  execute a render; it scores render/verification *configuration*: toolchain configs, the v2.5
  `pdffonts`/`fc-list`/`kpsewhich` render-dependency check, docs-render/link-check CI, and
  Research-Documentation verification artifacts). The code-centric **No test infrastructure** /
  thin-coverage risks are suppressed for doc-only repos and replaced with render/verification
  advisories; the **Large files** risk is fixed (unconditionally) to fire only on a *source* file,
  so a 2500-line `.md`/`.tex` chapter no longer trips it; the doc-to-source ratio display shows
  `n/a (doc-only)` / Doc LOC instead of a misleading `0.000`. Two BL-5 polish items ride along:
  `.gitignore` now covers `starter-kit/__pycache__/`, and **Signal F** (unmigrated `- [x]` BACKLOG
  done-marks) is gated on methodology adoption so it can't fire on a non-adopter sibling. Adds
  `tools/test_methodology_dashboard.py` — the **first functional scoring tests** (29 cases, stdlib
  `unittest`, canonical-only) — wired into `bin/tests.sh` (51 → 54 suite checks). Advisory tool,
  **no hard gate**. Resolves fork backlog **BL-5** (the `[BL-5]` BACKLOG removal lands on fork
  `main` at merge, since this upstream-based branch carries no `docs/planning/`). Designated
  framework **v3.2** (minor) — annotated tag + GitHub Release at the PR #50 merge commit;
  `DASHBOARD_VERSION` bumps **2.7.0 → 2.8.0**. → full narrative:
  [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.2"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Commit/PR:** `b2efd76` (dashboard logic, both twins) · `536837f` (tests + `.gitignore` +
  `bin/tests.sh` wiring + ledger) · `bad258c` (review-hardening fixes) · this commit (v3.2 release
  narration — `CLAUDE.md` §Versioning + `README.md` What's New) — branch
  `feat/dashboard-doc-only-scoring` (from `upstream/main`) → [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50).
  Design pressure-tested by a judge panel + adversarial synthesis (`wf_7174281b-754`); the
  implementation was then hardened by a 4-dimension adversarial review + default-to-refuted verify (`wf_7c95bb29-131`).
- **Session:** BL-5 dashboard doc-only scoring · **Verified:** 29/29 dashboard unit tests + 54/54
  `bin/tests.sh`; twins byte-identical + both `DASHBOARD_VERSION` 2.8.0; real runs — this mixed
  repo stays code-scored (Testing kept; Large-files still trips on the 2465-line `.py`), a
  synthetic doc-only tree detects doc-only, fills the slot with Render/Verify, and drops the false
  no-test-infra + big-`.md` risks; no `starter-kit/__pycache__` generated. The review found **6
  real defects** — a BOM-prefixed `.methodology-profile` override silently dropped; the large-file
  check inspecting only `largest[0]` (a non-source #1 masking a real large source file below it);
  `fmt_ratio` mislabeling a zero-source *code* repo `(doc-only)`; the footnote printing a false
  `source_loc ≤ 200` on a marker-forced repo; a tautological cap test; an untested render-dependency
  advisory — **all fixed and regression-tested**.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #49 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 follow-up 1c closed
- **Change:** [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49) (BL-6 follow-up 1c —
  `sample-project/.gitignore` ignores the tutorial smoke-test store `demo.json`) merged to `KJ5HST/main`
  (merge `ca7c063`); fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `68488e1`, resolving
  one `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict, reconciled newest-on-top); the head branch
  `docs/sample-gitignore-demo-json` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` marks 1c merged.
  With this, **all BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b/1c are shipped**; BL-6 items 2–3 and BL-5 remain. Canonical-only
  tutorial asset — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49) → merge `ca7c063`; fork-sync merge `68488e1`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 1c merge/close-out · **Verified:** `sample-project/.gitignore` byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] sample-project/.gitignore ignores demo.json (Tutorial 2/3 smoke-test store)
- **Change:** `docs/tutorials/sample-project/.gitignore` now ignores **`demo.json`** — the `--file demo.json`
  store that the Tutorial 2 (and Tutorial 3) Phase 3E runtime smoke test writes. The ignore list previously
  covered only `todos.json`/`__pycache__/`/`.pytest_cache/`, and T2's 3F stages four named files, so a
  learner replaying T2 was left with `demo.json` **untracked** after close-out — undercutting the clean-tree
  discipline the tutorial teaches. `demo.json` is the only non-ignored artifact the tutorials generate
  (verified: sole `--file` store; the default `todos.json` is already ignored). Resolves fork backlog BL-6
  follow-up 1c. Canonical-only tutorial asset — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** `f84a440` (branch `docs/sample-gitignore-demo-json`) → [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49), merged `ca7c063` (canonical-only tutorial asset, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 follow-up 1c · **Verified:** 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; grep-confirmed `demo.json` is the complete untracked-artifact set (T2/T3 `--file` sweep); co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #48 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b closed, 1c filed
- **Change:** [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48) (BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b — the
  `HOW_TO_USE.md` Phase 3E smoke-test re-letter + `T1_setup.md` setup commit) merged to `KJ5HST/main`
  (merge `be0a523`); fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `cc6023a`, resolving
  one `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict, reconciled newest-on-top); the head branch
  `docs/closeout-3e-smoke-and-t1-commit` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` marks 1a/1b
  merged and files a new follow-up **1c** (`sample-project/.gitignore` misses `demo.json`, surfaced by the
  PR #48 re-verify). Docs-lag correction — **no version event**. BL-6 items 2–3 and follow-up 1c remain open.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48) → merge `be0a523`; fork-sync merge `cc6023a`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 1a/1b merge/close-out · **Verified:** distributed `HOW_TO_USE.md` + `docs/tutorials/{T1_setup,T2_worked_transcript}.md` byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] HOW_TO_USE close-out gains Phase 3E smoke test (re-lettered 3E→3F, 3F→3G); T1 commits the seeded ledger
- **Change:** two v3.1 close-out fidelity fixes to the teaching docs (fork backlog BL-6 follow-ups 1a + 1b).
  **1a** — `HOW_TO_USE.md` §Phase 3 Close Out gained the missing **3E: Runtime smoke test** step and
  re-lettered the trailing two to match canonical `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (Commit **3E→3F**, Report and STOP
  **3F→3G**); the FM #27 ledger recording stays in the re-lettered **3F Commit**, and the failure-mode
  table now cites the close-out letters (FM #24 → Phase 3E, FM #27 → Phase 3F). **1b** —
  `docs/tutorials/T1_setup.md` Step 6 now explicitly commits the setup (`git add -A && git commit`) so the
  Step-1-seeded `CHANGELOG.md`/`ROADMAP.md` are tracked before the first session; Step 5 now gitignores the
  generated `dashboard.html` (so `git add -A` stays clean and Tutorial 2's clean-tree premise holds), and
  `T2_worked_transcript.md`'s seed citation is reconciled to **[T1 Step 1]**. Docs-lag correction — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** `85aca72` (branch `docs/closeout-3e-smoke-and-t1-commit`) → [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48), merged `be0a523` (docs-lag correction, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b · **Verified:** 6-lens adversarial review → 6 findings fixed (2 majors: the T1↔T2 `git commit -am` contradiction and `git add -A` sweeping in `dashboard.html`); 2 focused re-verifies returned CONSISTENT + CLEAN; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #47 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 item 1 fully closed
- **Change:** [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (the BL-6 item-1 `HOW_TO_USE.md` +
  `T2_*` FM #27 pedagogical refresh) merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `3bb7825`); fork `main` synced via
  `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `6db6a03`, resolving one `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict — the
  fork's `[BL-6]` / v3.1 entries vs. the branch's own `[ad hoc]` entry, reconciled newest-on-top); the head
  branch `docs/how-to-use-fm27-ledger` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` BL-6 item 1
  marked merged. Docs-lag correction — **no version event** (FM #27 already shipped in v3.1). BL-6 items
  2–3 and follow-ups 1a/1b remain open.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) → merge `3bb7825`; fork-sync merge `6db6a03`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 item-1 merge/close-out · **Verified:** distributed files (`HOW_TO_USE.md`, `T2_first_session.md`, `T2_worked_transcript.md`) byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact (issue / BL / ad-hoc all present).

### 2026-07-08 · [BL-6] Groom BL-6 — item 1 (pedagogical refresh) shipped via PR #47; file follow-ups 1a/1b
- **Change:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` BL-6 updated — item 1 (HOW_TO_USE + T2-tutorial FM #27 / count
  refresh) marked ✅ shipped via upstream [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (pending
  merge). Two follow-ups discovered during the refresh filed under BL-6: **1a** — `HOW_TO_USE.md`'s
  close-out enumeration still lacks canonical's Phase 3E runtime smoke-test step and its 3E/3F lettering
  lags canonical (its own future upstream PR); **1b** — `T1_setup.md` never explicitly commits the seeded
  `CHANGELOG.md`, so a learner can reach Tutorial 2 with it untracked. Items 2–3 (seed-format migration
  affordance, hook-distribution decision) remain open. Fork-only; not part of any upstream PR.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`); the refresh itself is [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (see the `[ad hoc]` entry on that branch).
- **Session:** BL-6 item 1 · **Verified:** n/a — `docs/planning` grooming only.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] HOW_TO_USE + T2 tutorials: sync close-out docs to the v3.1 FM #27 ledger
- **Change:** `HOW_TO_USE.md` (a distributed file) and the `docs/tutorials/T2_*` pair predated failure
  mode #27 and still taught a pre-ledger close-out. Now current: `HOW_TO_USE.md` FM count **23 → 27**
  (two sites) with compressed rows **24–27** added, and the `CHANGELOG.md` action-ledger recording folded
  into the 3E close-out step (cited as Failure Mode #27); `T2_first_session.md` + `T2_worked_transcript.md`
  show the Phase 3F ledger entry, the paired `BACKLOG.md` removal for a `[BL-N]` item, and explicit
  `git add` staging (so a freshly-seeded, still-untracked ledger is not silently dropped by `git commit -am`).
  Resolves the pedagogical-refresh half of fork backlog BL-6. Deliberately out of scope, tracked as a
  BL-6 follow-up: `HOW_TO_USE.md`'s close-out enumeration still lacks the Phase 3E runtime smoke-test step
  and its 3E/3F lettering lags canonical.
- **Commit/PR:** `1f436f4` (branch `docs/how-to-use-fm27-ledger`) → [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47), merged `3bb7825` (docs-lag correction, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 item 1 · **Verified:** 6-lens adversarial review (4 fidelity findings fixed); 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] v3.1 shipped — PR #46 merged, tag + GitHub Release cut, fork synced
- **Change:** the held v3.1 deployment gate cleared after the v3.0→v3.1 adopter-migration trial passed
  (operator post-trial confirm). PR #46 merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `75a6853`); the annotated tag
  `v3.1` was cut at that commit and its **GitHub Release published + marked Latest**; fork `main` synced
  (`1adf6b3`, 0 behind upstream) and the tag mirrored to `origin` (identical tag object `202669a` on both
  remotes); the merged feature branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger` was pruned (local + origin).
  Failure-mode count is now **27**.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #46](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/46) → merge `75a6853`; fork-sync
  merge `1adf6b3` (this entry). Release: <https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/releases/tag/v3.1>.
  → full narrative: [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.1"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** v3.1 deploy · **Verified:** 6-dimension adversarial release-readiness pass (version strings,
  FM #27 count, README↔§Versioning parity, ledger integrity, `.githooks/pre-commit`, close-out
  propagation) — clean; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; tag object byte-identical on `upstream` + `origin`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] BOOTSTRAP: add earlier-version→v3.1 adopter migration note (seed CHANGELOG not auto-updated)
- **Change:** a local v3.0→v3.1 adopter-migration trial (real `bin/sync` against a pristine v3.0 tree)
  confirmed the update path is sound — **8 tracked files upgrade with no `--force`**, drift guard intact —
  but surfaced that the recomposed action-ledger seed (`CHANGELOG.md`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`) does **not**
  reach existing adopters (seed = write-if-absent, never clobbered). `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` gains an
  "Updating an existing project from an earlier methodology version" note: prefer `--source=local` from a
  full checkout, and manually reconcile (or delete-and-reseed) an older `CHANGELOG.md` to pick up the
  action-ledger format. Remaining loose ends (HOW_TO_USE / tutorial refresh, optional adopter re-seed
  tooling, hook-distribution decision) tracked in fork backlog BL-6.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit — branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger` (held; pre-`v3.1`).
- **Session:** adopter-migration trial · **Verified:** live migration (dry-run + real sync + byte-compare) + 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; this commit co-staged the ledger through the shipped `.githooks/pre-commit` gate.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] v3.1 release narration — §Versioning + What's New; tag + Release at PR #46 merge
- **Change:** the CHANGELOG-ledger campaign (S2–S7) is designated **v3.1** — a minor bump (first new
  failure mode since v2.7). `CLAUDE.md` §Versioning gains the narrated v3.1 entry, `README.md` §What's
  New its public restatement; the annotated tag `v3.1` + GitHub Release are cut at the PR #46 merge commit.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (release narration) · [PR #46](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/46). → full narrative: [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.1"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** S7 · **Verified:** 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] Authoritative CHANGELOG ledger campaign — gate + reconcile + dashboard + hook (S2–S7 complete)
- **Change:** `CHANGELOG.md` is now a dependable cross-source action ledger, closed on two
  mechanisms rather than one: a write-time gate (FM #27, Phase 3F), a reconcile-on-read backstop
  (Phase 0), a recomposed seed template, a dashboard freshness monitor, this dogfooded root ledger,
  a `.githooks/pre-commit` co-staging gate (decision D1 — the mechanical enforcement where a repo
  has no root runner), and the ledger close-out step propagated into every session-type and campaign
  checklist (escape #8). The whole campaign S2–S7 is complete.
- **Commit/PR:** `2227aab` (S2, FM #27) · `4828929` (S3, Phase 0 reconcile) · `f25e0c4` (S4, seed) ·
  `89b8f60` (S5, dashboard) · `339dfb2` (S6, root ledger) · `d2184cc` (S7, checklists) · this commit
  (S7, hook + docs) — branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger`.
  Ratified plan: [`docs/planning/changelog-authoritative-ledger-gate-plan.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/main/docs/planning/changelog-authoritative-ledger-gate-plan.md) (`1710e90`, fork `main` only).
- **Session:** S7 · **Verified:** 9/9 hook behavior tests (block / pass / absent-ledger / mid-merge / `--no-verify`) + 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`.

<!-- Entries below were backfilled at ledger creation (S6), covering everything v3.0-forward per decision D5.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] Operational backlog reopened with BL-5 after full retirement
- **Change:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` was retired 2026-07-06 once BL-1/2/3/4 all closed, then
  reopened 2026-07-07 with BL-5 (make `methodology_dashboard.py` adapt scoring to document-only repos).
- **Commit/PR:** `ff5cee9` (retire) · `72dc914` (reopen with BL-5). *(fork `main`)*
- **Session:** S6 (backfill) · **Verified:** n/a — docs-only (planning).

- **Session:** S6 (backfill) · **Verified:** n/a — docs-only.

### 2026-07-06 · [ad hoc] Released v3.0.1 — REUSE-compliance metadata + README badges
- **Change:** the repo's already-MIT licensing was made machine-readable (REUSE Spec 3.3); a patch
  release was cut on top of v3.0 (not a re-point — v3.0 left untouched).
- **Commit/PR:** annotated tag `v3.0.1` at `aa822f6` (the PR #44 merge). → full narrative: [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.0.1"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** S6 (backfill) · **Verified:** `reuse lint` 53/53; live REUSE badge scanned compliant.

### 2026-07-06 · [ad hoc] PR #44 merged — REUSE.toml + LICENSES/MIT.txt + README badges
- **Change:** added `REUSE.toml` (single bulk `path = "**"` MIT annotation), `LICENSES/MIT.txt`, and

**Release history before v3.0 (v1.0 – v2.9):** not re-narrated here — see [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning](CLAUDE.md#versioning)
for the per-version narrative and `README.md` §What's New for the public restatement. This ledger is
prepend-only from v3.0 forward (decision D5: an authoritative ledger needs no hole at its recent edge,
and duplicating §Versioning would violate cite-don't-restate).
