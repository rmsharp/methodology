# Changelog — Authoritative Action Ledger

The cumulative, append-only record of **actions taken in this repository** — across backlog
items, repository issues, and ad-hoc work. It is the authoritative answer to *"what was done
here, ever?"*, distinct from the release narrative in [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning](CLAUDE.md#versioning).

This repository dogfoods its own methodology: every session records its actions here at
close-out (`starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 3F), and Phase 0 reconciles the ledger against
`git log` and backfills anything a crashed or out-of-band session missed. Taking an action — any
commit, or any non-commit action (release, tag, PR, upstream issue close, access grant, grooming
decision) — and not recording it is failure mode #27. The full close-out and reconcile rules, plus
the reusable seed, live in [`starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md`](starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md).

**Source tag — exactly one per entry**, so `grep -E '\[(issue #|BL-|ad hoc)' CHANGELOG.md`
enumerates every logged action and proves all three sources landed:

- `[issue #<N>]` — a repository issue. Issues for this repo live in the **upstream** parent
  `KJ5HST/methodology` (this fork has Issues disabled), so entries cite an **absolute URL**, never
  a bare `#<N>`.
- `[BL-<N>]` — a `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` item, removed from the backlog in the same commit.
- `[ad hoc]` — work with no backlog or issue origin: releases, tag/branch ops, PR opens, upstream
  issue closes, access grants, and decline/wontfix/grooming decisions.

**Boundary vs. `CLAUDE.md` §Versioning — so the two ledgers cannot diverge.** §Versioning owns
*released-version semantics* (one narrated entry per shipped version); `README.md` §What's New is
its public restatement. This ledger is the *per-action operational timeline*, including
non-release work (housekeeping, doc-only PRs, adopter coordination, backlog grooming) that
otherwise has no home but raw `git log`. Where the two overlap — a release — this ledger carries a
**one-line pointer** into §Versioning, never a re-narration (cite, don't restate).

Reverse-chronological, newest on top; prepend-only. Promote to `## YYYY-MM` sections as it grows.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Released v3.4 — completeness-critic review lens
- **Change:** version bumped **v3.3 → v3.4** (`CLAUDE.md` "Current version" line + a new §Versioning
  entry; `README.md` What's New) covering the completeness-critic lens (issue #55). Cite-don't-restate:
  the full narrative lives in [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.4"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (release narration) → merged; annotated tag `v3.4` + GitHub Release.
- **Session:** release · **Verified:** `bin/tests.sh` 84/84; `bin/check-links` clean.

### 2026-07-08 · [issue #55] Completeness-critic review lens — new Learning #10 + AUDIT_WORKSTREAM guidance
- **Change:** promotes **Learning #7** (cross-reference completeness at self-review) and **Learning #8**
  (close-out-gate checklist propagation) from authoring-time self-checks to an explicit **review-time
  lens**: when a change adds, renames, or removes a concept, artifact, file, step, or numbered-set
  member, a review/audit pass now owes a whole-corpus sweep (not just the diff) for enumerations,
  worked examples, indexes, and count-claims that now lag. Three files: **`SESSION_RUNNER.md`** new
  **Learning #10** (table was 1-9); **`AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md`** new anti-pattern **#9** "Diff-scoped blind
  spot" (list was 1-8), a new Verification Checklist bullet, and a note that `/code-review`/`/review`/
  `/security-review` are diff-scoped by design so the sweep stays methodology-owned; **`ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`**
  one sentence added to §Review/Audit Sessions citing the new Learning + the operative checklist step.
  Motivated by the v3.3 doc-completeness gap (PR #54) that a clean 6-lens adversarial review missed —
  [KJ5HST/methodology#55](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/55). **No new phase, gate,
  principle, or workstream; failure-mode count stays 27.** All three touched files are
  `bin/_manifest.py`-distributed, so adopters receive this via `bin/sync`.
- **Design verification:** drafted, then adversarially checked by a 4-lens review (acceptance-criteria
  coverage, numbering/citation fact-check, a reflexive Learning-#7 self-check for other stale
  cross-references, and placement/precedent judgment) — 2 of 4 lenses clean, 2 raised real findings
  (a mis-anchored insertion point in `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md`'s Recommended Skills section; a citation
  missing the `starter-kit/` path prefix used elsewhere in the repo) — both fixed before commit.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit — branch `feat/completeness-critic-review-lens` (from `upstream/main`).
- **Session:** completeness-critic lens · **Verified:** `bin/tests.sh` 84/84; `bin/check-links` clean.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Backfilled (reconcile-on-read): HANDOFFS.md was 3 sessions behind
- **Change:** Phase 0 orientation found `HANDOFFS.md`'s frontier (`4b0b1bc`, the S1 receipt) was 3
  sessions stale — the v3.3 release, the doc-completeness follow-up, and the issue #55 filing had all
  landed commits with no receipt written. Reconstructed `status: reconciled` blocks for **S2** (release,
  `dd2c84b`/`4ec1f47`), **S3** (doc-completeness, `67581fd`/`768631e`), and **S4** (issue #55,
  `6591faa`) from `git log` and each session's own CHANGELOG entry, per `SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 0
  step 6's "also reconcile `HANDOFFS.md`" mechanic — this ledger (`CHANGELOG.md`) itself needed no
  backfill (its frontier was already current). Also corrected S1's `commit: pending` to the real merge
  sha (`e5638af`) now that PR #52 has landed, per `HANDOFFS.md`'s own documented reconcile note ("the
  next session reconciles them to real shas"). First real exercise of the reconcile mechanic P4 built —
  and a live instance of the completeness-critic gap issue #55 (see the release/lens entries above,
  and the issue-filing entry below) names.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`; `HANDOFFS.md` backfill, one write Phase 0 permits).
- **Session:** Phase 0 reconcile · **Verified:** `bin/check-handoff` OK on the newest receipt;
  `bin/tests.sh` 84/84; `bin/check-links` clean.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Opened upstream issue #55 — completeness-critic review pass
- **Change:** filed [KJ5HST/methodology#55](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/issues/55) proposing a
  **completeness-critic** review lens — reviews should sweep the *whole corpus* (not just the diff) for
  enumerations / worked examples / indexes / count-claims a change made stale, promoting Learning #7/#8
  from an authoring self-check to a review lens. Motivated by the v3.3 out-of-diff doc lag (caught by the
  operator, fixed in #54) that a clean 6-lens adversarial review missed.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main` ledger record; the issue itself lives upstream).
- **Session:** ad hoc · **Verified:** n/a — issue creation.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] v3.3 doc-completeness — propagate the receipt into HOW_TO_USE, README tree, tutorials
- **Change:** the v3.3 close-out receipt is now reflected in the *secondary* docs that describe or
  demonstrate close-out, closing the Learning #7 propagation gap the release surfaced (the operator
  asked "has documentation been fully updated?" — it had not). **`HOW_TO_USE.md`** §Phase 3 3D now names
  the durable `HANDOFFS.md` receipt (it is DISTRIBUTED — was inconsistent with the synced
  `SESSION_RUNNER.md`); **`README.md`** Repository-Structure tree lists `HANDOFFS.md` (starter-kit) +
  `check-handoff` (bin/); the **tutorials** `T2_worked_transcript.md` (a full ` ```handoff ` receipt in
  its Phase-3 close-out + the receipt joins the `git add`), `T2_first_session.md` (1B receipt stub + the
  3D/expected-result), and `T3_compounding_loop.md` (the receipt carries `predecessor_score`, making the
  compounding loop machine-checkable). Mirrors the v3.1→BL-6 downstream-completeness pattern; **no version
  event** (docs-lag). No principle/phase/gate/workstream/FM change.
- **Commit/PR:** `67581fd` (distributed: `HOW_TO_USE.md` + `README.md`) · this commit (tutorials:
  `T2_worked_transcript.md`, `T2_first_session.md`, `T3_compounding_loop.md`) — branch
  `docs/v3.3-doc-completeness` (from `upstream/main`).
- **Session:** doc-completeness follow-on · **Verified:** `bin/check-links` clean; a completeness sweep
  found no other tutorial demonstrating close-out without the receipt (T5 only references a prior handoff).

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Released v3.3 — durable close-out receipt
- **Change:** version bumped **v3.2 → v3.3** (`CLAUDE.md` "Current version" line + a new §Versioning
  entry; `README.md` What's New) and shipped as an **annotated tag `v3.3` + GitHub Release (Latest)**,
  covering the close-out-receipt slice (PR #52, merge `e5638af`). Cite-don't-restate: the full narrative
  lives in [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.3"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (release narration) → merged; annotated tag `v3.3` + GitHub Release.
- **Session:** release · **Verified:** post-merge `bin/tests.sh` green — Test 9's github-source 404
  clears now that `HANDOFFS.md` is on the default branch.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Close-out receipt — durable machine-checkable handoff artifact (shipped in v3.3, PR #52)
- **Change:** implemented the ratified plan (fork `main`:
  `docs/planning/close-out-receipt-durable-artifact-plan.md`) as a pre-declared **vertical slice** —
  one capability, checkpoint commit + verification at each layer boundary. Fixes "agent had to be
  prompted for the close-out report." **P1:** new `starter-kit/HANDOFFS.md` SEED — a
  per-session `handoff`-block receipt ledger (twin of this action ledger) — added to `bin/_manifest.py`
  `DISTRIBUTION` (SEED) + `SEED_FORMAT_MARKERS` (`"Handoff Receipts"`); `sync` seeds it, `status`
  reports `present` / `present (stale format)`, `sync` never clobbers it. **P2:** `bin/check-handoff`
  (canonical-only, python3 stdlib) + `bin/tests.sh` Tests 21–22 — asserts a receipt's presence +
  structural completeness (fence-isolated block, integer scores, `path:line` in `key_files`, sha-or-
  `pending` in `what_was_done`) plus anti-pattern lints (rejects "pick next from backlog", "need to
  verify", bare placeholders), never semantic quality. **P3a:** protocol wiring — `SESSION_RUNNER.md`
  (1B receipt stub, 3D "write the six as a durable receipt", Planning checklist, slice-revert) +
  `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` (Phase 1B, Phase 6 step 7, the Review/Planning/Debugging session types).
  **P3b:** the receipt item added to all three campaign checklists (per-session + consolidation) —
  Learning #8 fully discharged. **P4:** Phase 0 reconcile-on-read extended to backstop the receipt — a
  missing or still-`pending` receipt for a session that left commits is reconstructed `status:
  reconciled` at the next Orient, folded into the one write Phase 0 already permits (`SESSION_RUNNER.md`
  step 6 + mechanics note, `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` Pre-Flight). **P5:** framing — strengthened
  **FM #6** to name the durable receipt (count stays 27, no new FM), a degradation-detection row
  (commits landed but receipt never completed → FM #6), **Learning #9** (a handoff is dependable only
  as a durable machine-checkable artifact: gate-on-write AND reconcile-on-read), and the
  SAFEGUARDS/BOOTSTRAP harness stop-hook **recommendation** (agent-specific, soft-remind, never shipped;
  `bin/check-handoff` noted canonical-only/copyable). **P6:** dogfood close-out — the canonical repo's
  own root `HANDOFFS.md` receives its first receipt (S1) for this very slice, and `bin/check-handoff`
  validates it green (first non-fixture run). Merged to `KJ5HST/main` as **PR #52** (merge `e5638af`);
  the version event (D4) resolved to a **v3.3** minor — see the release entry above.
- **Commit/PR:** `4f0bea7` (P1: artifact + manifest) · `1646773` (P2: checker + tests, built by
  Sonnet 5; Opus review accepted `status: reconciled` for P4's backfill and made the `HANDOFFS.md`
  template checker-safe — no inline `#` comments, since `#` is a literal value char as in `PR #52`) ·
  `f722a84` (P3a: SESSION_RUNNER + IM protocol wiring, Opus) · `afbbe7d` (P3b: 3 campaign
  checklists, Opus) · `5f13c99` (P4: Phase 0 receipt reconcile, built by Sonnet 5; Opus review
  verified the false-positive scoping — one receipt per session, not per commit — and documented the
  `reconciled` status in the seed) · `719a41d` (P5: framing — FM #6 + degradation row + Learning #9 +
  stop-hook recommendation, Opus) · this commit (P6: dogfood root receipt + final verification, Opus —
  P6's deliverable is the session's own handoff, so authored, not delegated) — branch
  `feat/close-out-receipt` (from `upstream/main`); model
  split hybrid — **P2 + P4 Sonnet 5; P1/P3/P5/P6 Opus 4.8**, Opus reviewing every Sonnet phase (P6
  moved to Opus because its deliverable is the session's own close-out handoff, not a delegable task).
- **Final review & fixes:** a 6-lens adversarial review (`wf_91880f5f-35c`, default-to-refute verify) —
  **12 raised → 7 confirmed → all fixed** across 3 checkpoint commits. **Fix A (checker, this commit):**
  `key_files`'s `path:line` regex now requires a **path-like** pre-colon token (`/` or `.`), so an
  incidental colon-digit in prose (`John 3:16`, `10:30`, `3:1`) no longer passes (C1); `what_was_done`'s
  sha-shape now requires a **hex letter**, so a bare 7+ digit decimal/timestamp no longer counts as a sha
  (C2); + a docstring caveat that an unwrapped example fence shadows the real receipt (C7). Regression
  tests added (**81 → 83**). **Fix B (synced docs):** the mandatory-procedure references to
  `bin/check-handoff` in `SESSION_RUNNER.md` §3D, `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` Phase 6, and the
  `HANDOFFS.md` seed now carry the "canonical-only — copy it in; the dependable backstop is Phase 0
  reconcile" caveat the optional-hook subsections already had (C4/C5), and the receipt-to-requirements
  wording no longer double-counts `self_score` (C6: "the six requirements, the sixth being `self_score`,
  plus `predecessor_score`"). **Fix C (this commit):** `HANDOFFS.md` added to BOOTSTRAP's seed
  enumerations (repo tree, root-files table, both "seeded"/"seeded-once" sentences) — deliberately NOT
  the named three-file `BACKLOG`/`CHANGELOG`/`ROADMAP` task-tracking split (HANDOFFS is a close-out
  record, not part of that concept; "three" stays accurate); the campaign per-session checklists drop
  the bare `bin/check-handoff` mention (its caveated form stays in §3D). **All 7 confirmed findings fixed**
  (`28cecc8` A · `ac97722` B · this commit C). 5 findings were refuted (e.g. the missing `--range`
  mode — plan-optional; the last-wins duplicate-key parse — benign).
- **Session:** close-out-receipt slice · **Verified:** `bin/tests.sh` **83/84** (the 1 = github-source
  404 on the not-yet-pushed `HANDOFFS.md`, clears on merge); `bin/check-links` clean; block-isolation +
  per-field-defect + C1/C2-regression fixtures green; **`bin/check-handoff` green on the first real
  receipt** (root `HANDOFFS.md`, S1 — dogfood, first non-fixture run).

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Reopen backlog — BL-7 (consider: model-tiering as an elective feature)
- **Change:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` reopened with **BL-7** (a *consider* item): whether matching
  model capability to task complexity — cheaper tier for spec-driven/test-graded work, strongest tier for
  high-blast-radius doc surgery + reviewing all cheaper-tier output — should become an **elective**
  methodology feature (recommendation layer; capability-tier framing for agent-independence; same risk
  lens as §Matching Reasoning Effort to Stakes). Surfaced by the operator while watching this repo's own
  close-out-receipt slice run on a hybrid Sonnet-5 / Opus-4.8 split. No phase/gate/FM change; planning-only.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`, `docs/planning/` is fork-only).
- **Session:** ad hoc grooming · **Verified:** n/a — backlog/docs only.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Close-out receipt plan ratified — durable `HANDOFFS.md` artifact + reconcile, no CI
- **Change:** new fork-only ratified plan `docs/planning/close-out-receipt-durable-artifact-plan.md`.
  Fixes the failure "agent had to be prompted for the mandatory close-out report" by making the handoff a
  durable, machine-checkable `HANDOFFS.md` receipt (SEED twin of this action ledger, one `handoff` block
  per session) + a canonical-only `bin/check-handoff` + a Phase 0 reconcile backstop + strengthened
  **FM #6** (count stays 27) + a *recommended* (never shipped) harness stop-hook. Scope ratified as
  **durable-receipt-+-reconcile, NO server-side CI**; decisions D1–D5 settled. Design workflow
  `wf_4793d8f5-b5b` (6 readers → 5 lens proposals → synthesis + adversarial critique).
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork-only planning deliverable; implementation P1–P6 pending, to branch off `upstream/main`).
- **Session:** planning · **Verified:** n/a — docs-only (plan document).

### 2026-07-08 · [BL-6] BL-6 fully closed — item 2 shipped (PR #51), item 3 decided (hook canonical-only)
- **Change:** with the seed-format advisory merged (the `[ad hoc]` entry below / PR #51), the fork
  backlog's last item is complete and **removed from `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` "Open items"** (moved to
  the Completed table). **Item 2** (seed-format migration discoverability) shipped in PR #51 — advisory,
  no version event. **Item 3** (hook distribution) is **decided: keep `.githooks/pre-commit`
  canonical-only** — adopters run the Phase 3F ledger gate via their root `SESSION_RUNNER.md`, so
  distributing the hook would add a per-clone `git config core.hooksPath` enable step + a maintenance
  surface for a mechanism they already have (the hook exists only because *this* repo has no root runner
  to run the gate on itself). The hook is **not** added to `bin/_manifest.py`. With BL-6 done, BL-1 –
  BL-6 are all complete and the fork backlog is retired again.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main` — `BACKLOG.md` close-out + this ledger entry). Item-2 code
  shipped in [PR #51](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/51) (merge `48c253f`); fork-sync merge
  `9a84b8e`.
- **Session:** BL-6 close-out · **Verified:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` "## Open items" now shows none;
  the BL-6 Completed-table row records item 3's decision + rationale; ledger source-tag census intact
  (`[issue #]` / `[BL-]` / `[ad hoc]` all present).

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] bin/status flags stale-format adopter seeds (BL-6 item 2)
- **Change:** `bin/status` now surfaces a SEED file whose *format* predates the current methodology —
  advisory-only — as `present (stale format)`, with a one-line migration note beneath the table, so an
  adopter upgrading from a pre-v3.1 methodology can **discover** that its seeded `CHANGELOG.md` still
  carries the old (pre-action-ledger) shape instead of the lag being silent. Mechanism: a new generic
  `_manifest.SEED_FORMAT_MARKERS` dict (dest → marker), with `CHANGELOG.md` keyed on the ledger
  **title** `"Authoritative Action Ledger"` — a lifetime-stable token that append-only entries never
  remove — deliberately **not** the `METHODOLOGY-SEED-SENTINEL` (which the adopter deletes on its first
  real entry, so keying on it would mis-flag an *in-use* current-format ledger). `SESSION_NOTES.md` /
  `ROADMAP.md` are intentionally omitted (rewritten wholesale each session → no stable marker; add an
  entry only when a seed gains a lifetime-stable one). Detection is **advisory only**: `bin/sync` still
  never auto-overwrites an adopter-owned seed, the status string is never reclassified as drift, and the
  exit code is unchanged. Docs updated in lockstep: `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md`'s update-existing-project
  note and the `docs/tutorials/T8_keeping_current.md` SEED-state model now name the third state.
- **Commit/PR:** `346ac01` (feature + Test 20: `bin/_manifest.py` + `bin/status` + `bin/tests.sh`) ·
  `fe3e10a` (docs: `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` note + `docs/tutorials/T8_keeping_current.md` third
  state) — branch `feat/status-stale-seed-advisory` (from `upstream/main`) → [PR #51](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/51),
  merge `48c253f`. Design + fixes hardened by a 6-lens adversarial review + default-to-refuted verify
  (`wf_52a1df0d-068`): **5 findings confirmed → all fixed** (an in-use-ledger test-coverage gap that let
  a sentinel-keyed regression pass, a vacuous disposition assertion masked by the note line, a
  multi-project note undercount, and a `T8` doc-code mismatch).
- **Session:** BL-6 item 2 · **Verified:** `bin/tests.sh` **68/68** (new **Test 20**, 14 assertions;
  54 → 68); manual stale / current / absent cases; the marker survives an in-use ledger (root
  `CHANGELOG.md` carries the title, no sentinel); a sentinel-keyed regression now makes Test 20 **fail**
  — proving constraint #2 (no false positive on a current-format seed) is locked in by a test.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] v3.2 shipped — PR #50 merged, tag + GitHub Release cut, fork synced
- **Change:** the BL-5 dashboard doc-only scoring change was designated **v3.2** (minor) and shipped.
  [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `9bda167`);
  the annotated tag `v3.2` was cut at that commit and its **GitHub Release published + marked Latest**;
  fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `df2cac9`, resolving one
  `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict, reconciled newest-on-top) and the tag mirrored to `origin`.
  `DASHBOARD_VERSION` is now 2.8.0; the failure-mode count stays 27.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) → merge `9bda167`; fork-sync
  merge `df2cac9`; this commit (fork `main` — BL-5 backlog close-out + these ledger entries). Release:
  <https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/releases/tag/v3.2>. → full narrative:
  [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.2"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** BL-5 deploy · **Verified:** v3.2 GitHub Release is Latest (`releases/latest` = v3.2);
  distributed files byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; fork `main` 0 behind upstream.

### 2026-07-08 · [BL-5] Dashboard doc-only scoring closed — removed from fork backlog
- **Change:** with v3.2 shipped, **BL-5** ("adapt dashboard scoring to document-only repositories",
  including the Signal-F adopter-gate + `starter-kit/__pycache__` polish notes) is complete and
  **removed from `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` "Open items"** (moved to the Completed table). The fork
  backlog now has one open item — **BL-6 items 2–3** (seed-format migration affordance;
  hook-distribution decision).
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`). The dashboard change itself shipped in
  [PR #50](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/50) / v3.2 (see the entry above and the branch entry below).
- **Session:** BL-5 close-out · **Verified:** BL-5 no longer under "## Open items"; ledger source-tag census intact (`[issue #]` / `[BL-]` / `[ad hoc]` all present).

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] Dashboard: fair scoring for document-only / research repos (DASHBOARD_VERSION 2.8.0)
- **Change:** `methodology_dashboard.py` (both byte-identical twins, `tools/` + `starter-kit/`) now
  detects a **document-only / research** repo and reshapes scoring so it is no longer falsely
  penalized for having nothing to unit-test. Detection is marker-override → source-loc cap (200) →
  corpus-disjunction: an explicit bidirectional **`.methodology-profile`** marker (`doc-only` |
  `code`) wins; otherwise a repo with negligible source but a real doc corpus **or** a render
  toolchain (the latter catches pure-LaTeX/Quarto repos whose `.tex`/`.qmd` aren't counted as docs)
  is doc-only. When doc-only, the 2nd health slot (dict key `testing`, stable for JSON/portfolio)
  is filled by a new **Render/Verification** score — an *honest static proxy* (the scanner cannot
  execute a render; it scores render/verification *configuration*: toolchain configs, the v2.5
  `pdffonts`/`fc-list`/`kpsewhich` render-dependency check, docs-render/link-check CI, and
  Research-Documentation verification artifacts). The code-centric **No test infrastructure** /
  thin-coverage risks are suppressed for doc-only repos and replaced with render/verification
  advisories; the **Large files** risk is fixed (unconditionally) to fire only on a *source* file,
  so a 2500-line `.md`/`.tex` chapter no longer trips it; the doc-to-source ratio display shows
  `n/a (doc-only)` / Doc LOC instead of a misleading `0.000`. Two BL-5 polish items ride along:
  `.gitignore` now covers `starter-kit/__pycache__/`, and **Signal F** (unmigrated `- [x]` BACKLOG
  done-marks) is gated on methodology adoption so it can't fire on a non-adopter sibling. Adds
  `tools/test_methodology_dashboard.py` — the **first functional scoring tests** (29 cases, stdlib
  `unittest`, canonical-only) — wired into `bin/tests.sh` (51 → 54 suite checks). Advisory tool,
  **no hard gate**. Resolves fork backlog **BL-5** (the `[BL-5]` BACKLOG removal lands on fork
  `main` at merge, since this upstream-based branch carries no `docs/planning/`). Designated
  framework **v3.2** (minor) — annotated tag + GitHub Release at the PR #50 merge commit;
  `DASHBOARD_VERSION` bumps **2.7.0 → 2.8.0**. → full narrative:
  [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.2"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Commit/PR:** `b2efd76` (dashboard logic, both twins) · `536837f` (tests + `.gitignore` +

  Design pressure-tested by a judge panel + adversarial synthesis (`wf_7174281b-754`); the
  implementation was then hardened by a 4-dimension adversarial review + default-to-refuted verify (`wf_7c95bb29-131`).
- **Session:** BL-5 dashboard doc-only scoring · **Verified:** 29/29 dashboard unit tests + 54/54
  `bin/tests.sh`; twins byte-identical + both `DASHBOARD_VERSION` 2.8.0; real runs — this mixed
  repo stays code-scored (Testing kept; Large-files still trips on the 2465-line `.py`), a
  synthetic doc-only tree detects doc-only, fills the slot with Render/Verify, and drops the false
  no-test-infra + big-`.md` risks; no `starter-kit/__pycache__` generated. The review found **6
  real defects** — a BOM-prefixed `.methodology-profile` override silently dropped; the large-file
  check inspecting only `largest[0]` (a non-source #1 masking a real large source file below it);
  `fmt_ratio` mislabeling a zero-source *code* repo `(doc-only)`; the footnote printing a false
  `source_loc ≤ 200` on a marker-forced repo; a tautological cap test; an untested render-dependency
  advisory — **all fixed and regression-tested**.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #49 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 follow-up 1c closed
- **Change:** [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49) (BL-6 follow-up 1c —
  `sample-project/.gitignore` ignores the tutorial smoke-test store `demo.json`) merged to `KJ5HST/main`
  (merge `ca7c063`); fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `68488e1`, resolving
  one `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict, reconciled newest-on-top); the head branch
  `docs/sample-gitignore-demo-json` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` marks 1c merged.
  With this, **all BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b/1c are shipped**; BL-6 items 2–3 and BL-5 remain. Canonical-only
  tutorial asset — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49) → merge `ca7c063`; fork-sync merge `68488e1`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 1c merge/close-out · **Verified:** `sample-project/.gitignore` byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] sample-project/.gitignore ignores demo.json (Tutorial 2/3 smoke-test store)
- **Change:** `docs/tutorials/sample-project/.gitignore` now ignores **`demo.json`** — the `--file demo.json`
  store that the Tutorial 2 (and Tutorial 3) Phase 3E runtime smoke test writes. The ignore list previously
  covered only `todos.json`/`__pycache__/`/`.pytest_cache/`, and T2's 3F stages four named files, so a
  learner replaying T2 was left with `demo.json` **untracked** after close-out — undercutting the clean-tree
  discipline the tutorial teaches. `demo.json` is the only non-ignored artifact the tutorials generate
  (verified: sole `--file` store; the default `todos.json` is already ignored). Resolves fork backlog BL-6
  follow-up 1c. Canonical-only tutorial asset — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** `f84a440` (branch `docs/sample-gitignore-demo-json`) → [PR #49](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/49), merged `ca7c063` (canonical-only tutorial asset, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 follow-up 1c · **Verified:** 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; grep-confirmed `demo.json` is the complete untracked-artifact set (T2/T3 `--file` sweep); co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #48 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b closed, 1c filed
- **Change:** [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48) (BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b — the
  `HOW_TO_USE.md` Phase 3E smoke-test re-letter + `T1_setup.md` setup commit) merged to `KJ5HST/main`
  (merge `be0a523`); fork `main` synced via `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `cc6023a`, resolving

  `docs/closeout-3e-smoke-and-t1-commit` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` marks 1a/1b
  merged and files a new follow-up **1c** (`sample-project/.gitignore` misses `demo.json`, surfaced by the
  PR #48 re-verify). Docs-lag correction — **no version event**. BL-6 items 2–3 and follow-up 1c remain open.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48) → merge `be0a523`; fork-sync merge `cc6023a`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 1a/1b merge/close-out · **Verified:** distributed `HOW_TO_USE.md` + `docs/tutorials/{T1_setup,T2_worked_transcript}.md` byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] HOW_TO_USE close-out gains Phase 3E smoke test (re-lettered 3E→3F, 3F→3G); T1 commits the seeded ledger
- **Change:** two v3.1 close-out fidelity fixes to the teaching docs (fork backlog BL-6 follow-ups 1a + 1b).
  **1a** — `HOW_TO_USE.md` §Phase 3 Close Out gained the missing **3E: Runtime smoke test** step and
  re-lettered the trailing two to match canonical `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (Commit **3E→3F**, Report and STOP
  **3F→3G**); the FM #27 ledger recording stays in the re-lettered **3F Commit**, and the failure-mode
  table now cites the close-out letters (FM #24 → Phase 3E, FM #27 → Phase 3F). **1b** —
  `docs/tutorials/T1_setup.md` Step 6 now explicitly commits the setup (`git add -A && git commit`) so the
  Step-1-seeded `CHANGELOG.md`/`ROADMAP.md` are tracked before the first session; Step 5 now gitignores the
  generated `dashboard.html` (so `git add -A` stays clean and Tutorial 2's clean-tree premise holds), and
  `T2_worked_transcript.md`'s seed citation is reconciled to **[T1 Step 1]**. Docs-lag correction — **no version event**.
- **Commit/PR:** `85aca72` (branch `docs/closeout-3e-smoke-and-t1-commit`) → [PR #48](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/48), merged `be0a523` (docs-lag correction, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 follow-ups 1a/1b · **Verified:** 6-lens adversarial review → 6 findings fixed (2 majors: the T1↔T2 `git commit -am` contradiction and `git add -A` sweeping in `dashboard.html`); 2 focused re-verifies returned CONSISTENT + CLEAN; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] PR #47 merged to KJ5HST/main; fork synced; BL-6 item 1 fully closed
- **Change:** [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (the BL-6 item-1 `HOW_TO_USE.md` +
  `T2_*` FM #27 pedagogical refresh) merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `3bb7825`); fork `main` synced via
  `git merge upstream/main` (fork-sync merge `6db6a03`, resolving one `CHANGELOG.md` union conflict — the
  fork's `[BL-6]` / v3.1 entries vs. the branch's own `[ad hoc]` entry, reconciled newest-on-top); the head
  branch `docs/how-to-use-fm27-ledger` pruned (origin + local); `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` BL-6 item 1
  marked merged. Docs-lag correction — **no version event** (FM #27 already shipped in v3.1). BL-6 items
  2–3 and follow-ups 1a/1b remain open.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) → merge `3bb7825`; fork-sync merge `6db6a03`; this commit (fork `main` — BACKLOG close-out + this ledger entry).
- **Session:** BL-6 item-1 merge/close-out · **Verified:** distributed files (`HOW_TO_USE.md`, `T2_first_session.md`, `T2_worked_transcript.md`) byte-identical to `upstream/main` post-merge; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; ledger source-tag census intact (issue / BL / ad-hoc all present).

### 2026-07-08 · [BL-6] Groom BL-6 — item 1 (pedagogical refresh) shipped via PR #47; file follow-ups 1a/1b
- **Change:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` BL-6 updated — item 1 (HOW_TO_USE + T2-tutorial FM #27 / count
  refresh) marked ✅ shipped via upstream [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (pending
  merge). Two follow-ups discovered during the refresh filed under BL-6: **1a** — `HOW_TO_USE.md`'s
  close-out enumeration still lacks canonical's Phase 3E runtime smoke-test step and its 3E/3F lettering
  lags canonical (its own future upstream PR); **1b** — `T1_setup.md` never explicitly commits the seeded
  `CHANGELOG.md`, so a learner can reach Tutorial 2 with it untracked. Items 2–3 (seed-format migration
  affordance, hook-distribution decision) remain open. Fork-only; not part of any upstream PR.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit (fork `main`); the refresh itself is [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47) (see the `[ad hoc]` entry on that branch).
- **Session:** BL-6 item 1 · **Verified:** n/a — `docs/planning` grooming only.

### 2026-07-08 · [ad hoc] HOW_TO_USE + T2 tutorials: sync close-out docs to the v3.1 FM #27 ledger
- **Change:** `HOW_TO_USE.md` (a distributed file) and the `docs/tutorials/T2_*` pair predated failure
  mode #27 and still taught a pre-ledger close-out. Now current: `HOW_TO_USE.md` FM count **23 → 27**
  (two sites) with compressed rows **24–27** added, and the `CHANGELOG.md` action-ledger recording folded
  into the 3E close-out step (cited as Failure Mode #27); `T2_first_session.md` + `T2_worked_transcript.md`
  show the Phase 3F ledger entry, the paired `BACKLOG.md` removal for a `[BL-N]` item, and explicit
  `git add` staging (so a freshly-seeded, still-untracked ledger is not silently dropped by `git commit -am`).
  Resolves the pedagogical-refresh half of fork backlog BL-6. Deliberately out of scope, tracked as a
  BL-6 follow-up: `HOW_TO_USE.md`'s close-out enumeration still lacks the Phase 3E runtime smoke-test step
  and its 3E/3F lettering lags canonical.
- **Commit/PR:** `1f436f4` (branch `docs/how-to-use-fm27-ledger`) → [PR #47](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/47), merged `3bb7825` (docs-lag correction, no version event).
- **Session:** BL-6 item 1 · **Verified:** 6-lens adversarial review (4 fidelity findings fixed); 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; co-staged through `.githooks/pre-commit`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] v3.1 shipped — PR #46 merged, tag + GitHub Release cut, fork synced
- **Change:** the held v3.1 deployment gate cleared after the v3.0→v3.1 adopter-migration trial passed
  (operator post-trial confirm). PR #46 merged to `KJ5HST/main` (merge `75a6853`); the annotated tag
  `v3.1` was cut at that commit and its **GitHub Release published + marked Latest**; fork `main` synced
  (`1adf6b3`, 0 behind upstream) and the tag mirrored to `origin` (identical tag object `202669a` on both
  remotes); the merged feature branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger` was pruned (local + origin).
  Failure-mode count is now **27**.
- **Commit/PR:** [PR #46](https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/pull/46) → merge `75a6853`; fork-sync
  merge `1adf6b3` (this entry). Release: <https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology/releases/tag/v3.1>.
  → full narrative: [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.1"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).
- **Session:** v3.1 deploy · **Verified:** 6-dimension adversarial release-readiness pass (version strings,
  FM #27 count, README↔§Versioning parity, ledger integrity, `.githooks/pre-commit`, close-out
  propagation) — clean; 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; tag object byte-identical on `upstream` + `origin`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] BOOTSTRAP: add earlier-version→v3.1 adopter migration note (seed CHANGELOG not auto-updated)
- **Change:** a local v3.0→v3.1 adopter-migration trial (real `bin/sync` against a pristine v3.0 tree)
  confirmed the update path is sound — **8 tracked files upgrade with no `--force`**, drift guard intact —
  but surfaced that the recomposed action-ledger seed (`CHANGELOG.md`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`) does **not**
  reach existing adopters (seed = write-if-absent, never clobbered). `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` gains an
  "Updating an existing project from an earlier methodology version" note: prefer `--source=local` from a
  full checkout, and manually reconcile (or delete-and-reseed) an older `CHANGELOG.md` to pick up the
  action-ledger format. Remaining loose ends (HOW_TO_USE / tutorial refresh, optional adopter re-seed
  tooling, hook-distribution decision) tracked in fork backlog BL-6.
- **Commit/PR:** this commit — branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger` (held; pre-`v3.1`).
- **Session:** adopter-migration trial · **Verified:** live migration (dry-run + real sync + byte-compare) + 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`; this commit co-staged the ledger through the shipped `.githooks/pre-commit` gate.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] v3.1 release narration — §Versioning + What's New; tag + Release at PR #46 merge
- **Change:** the CHANGELOG-ledger campaign (S2–S7) is designated **v3.1** — a minor bump (first new
  failure mode since v2.7). `CLAUDE.md` §Versioning gains the narrated v3.1 entry, `README.md` §What's
  New its public restatement; the annotated tag `v3.1` + GitHub Release are cut at the PR #46 merge commit.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] Authoritative CHANGELOG ledger campaign — gate + reconcile + dashboard + hook (S2–S7 complete)
- **Change:** `CHANGELOG.md` is now a dependable cross-source action ledger, closed on two
  mechanisms rather than one: a write-time gate (FM #27, Phase 3F), a reconcile-on-read backstop
  (Phase 0), a recomposed seed template, a dashboard freshness monitor, this dogfooded root ledger,
  a `.githooks/pre-commit` co-staging gate (decision D1 — the mechanical enforcement where a repo
  has no root runner), and the ledger close-out step propagated into every session-type and campaign
  checklist (escape #8). The whole campaign S2–S7 is complete.
- **Commit/PR:** `2227aab` (S2, FM #27) · `4828929` (S3, Phase 0 reconcile) · `f25e0c4` (S4, seed) ·
  `89b8f60` (S5, dashboard) · `339dfb2` (S6, root ledger) · `d2184cc` (S7, checklists) · this commit
  (S7, hook + docs) — branch `feat/changelog-authoritative-ledger`.
  Ratified plan: [`docs/planning/changelog-authoritative-ledger-gate-plan.md`](https://github.com/rmsharp/methodology/blob/main/docs/planning/changelog-authoritative-ledger-gate-plan.md) (`1710e90`, fork `main` only).
- **Session:** S7 · **Verified:** 9/9 hook behavior tests (block / pass / absent-ledger / mid-merge / `--no-verify`) + 51/51 `bin/tests.sh`.

### 2026-07-07 · [ad hoc] Operational backlog reopened with BL-5 after full retirement
- **Change:** `docs/planning/BACKLOG.md` was retired 2026-07-06 once BL-1/2/3/4 all closed, then
  reopened 2026-07-07 with BL-5 (make `methodology_dashboard.py` adapt scoring to document-only repos).

- **Session:** S6 (backfill) · **Verified:** n/a — docs-only.

### 2026-07-06 · [ad hoc] Released v3.0.1 — REUSE-compliance metadata + README badges
- **Change:** the repo's already-MIT licensing was made machine-readable (REUSE Spec 3.3); a patch
  release was cut on top of v3.0 (not a re-point — v3.0 left untouched).
- **Commit/PR:** annotated tag `v3.0.1` at `aa822f6` (the PR #44 merge). → full narrative: [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning "v3.0.1"](CLAUDE.md#versioning).

**Release history before v3.0 (v1.0 – v2.9):** not re-narrated here — see [`CLAUDE.md` §Versioning](CLAUDE.md#versioning)
for the per-version narrative and `README.md` §What's New for the public restatement. This ledger is
prepend-only from v3.0 forward (decision D5: an authoritative ledger needs no hole at its recent edge,
and duplicating §Versioning would violate cite-don't-restate).
