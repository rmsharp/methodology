# Handoff Receipts — durable close-out proof

This repository dogfoods its own methodology: every session records a durable, machine-checkable
`handoff` receipt here at close-out (Phase 3D), and Phase 0 reconciles it against `git log`. See
[`starter-kit/HANDOFFS.md`](starter-kit/HANDOFFS.md) for the block format and the write points, and
`bin/check-handoff` for the checker. Newest on top; prepend-only.

```handoff
session: S1
date: 2026-07-08
status: complete
self_score: 8
active_task: Close-out receipt vertical slice (P1-P6) — durable HANDOFFS.md receipt + bin/check-handoff + Phase 0 reconcile backstop + framing. COMPLETE on branch feat/close-out-receipt; PR + version decision pending.
what_was_done: Shipped the close-out-receipt slice as 6 checkpoint commits — 4f0bea7 (P1 seed+manifest), 1646773 (P2 checker+tests), f722a84 (P3a SESSION_RUNNER+IM wiring), afbbe7d (P3b campaign checklists), 5f13c99 (P4 Phase 0 reconcile), 719a41d (P5 framing), plus this P6 dogfood commit. Hybrid model split: Sonnet 5 built P2/P4, Opus 4.8 did P3/P5/P6 and reviewed all Sonnet output.
next_steps: Open the PR from feat/close-out-receipt to KJ5HST/methodology; decide the version event at merge (D4 — CLAUDE.md §Versioning v3.3 vs none). Fork main already carries the ratified plan (6b9ccd7) and BL-7 (cb8165d); fork-sync after merge unions the CHANGELOG newest-on-top. Consider BL-7 (model-tiering as an elective feature) as a follow-on planning session.
key_files: starter-kit/HANDOFFS.md:1 (seed + format), bin/check-handoff:1 (checker), starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md:18 (Phase 0 receipt reconcile), docs/planning/close-out-receipt-durable-artifact-plan.md:1 (ratified plan, fork main)
gotchas: bin/check-handoff is canonical-only (not in bin/_manifest.py) — adopters get the synced write-step + reconcile and copy the checker if wanted. Test 9 (github-source) fails until this branch merges (HANDOFFS.md 404s on the remote). Receipt keys take no inline # comments (# is a literal value char, cf. PR #52). status: reconciled is written only by Phase 0 backfill, never by hand.
runtime_smoke: n/a — docs + python3-stdlib tooling; verified by bin/tests.sh 81/82 (the 1 = expected github-404), bin/check-handoff green on this receipt, and check-links clean

```
Self-score 8/10. **+** Full vertical slice with per-boundary verification (build/test + check-links at
every checkpoint) and a clean hybrid model split; **+** adversarial Opus review of the Sonnet phases
caught real defects (an inline-`#` template footgun, the `status: reconciled` doc gap, and confirmed the
reconcile's false-positive scoping is per-session not per-commit); **+** honest ceiling stated throughout
(structure not quality; a no-commit session still escapes). **−** Large single-session slice (6 commits)
— recoverable only because each layer is an independent checkpoint commit and it is ONE capability
(passes the FM #26 slice test); **−** unmerged and not yet operator-reviewed; the version event is
undecided. This is the first real receipt in this ledger (S1), so there is no predecessor to score.
