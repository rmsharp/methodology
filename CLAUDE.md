# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repository Is

A standalone methodology framework for structured, self-correcting AI agent sessions. It is **not a software project** — it contains no code to build, test, or run. The deliverables are markdown documents.

**Repository:** `git@github.com:KJ5HST/methodology.git`
**Author:** Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST)
**License:** Free to use, adapt, and implement with attribution — including for commercial operational use; may not be sold or commercially exploited as a standalone product/service/training material. See `LICENSE`.

## Document Hierarchy

Three layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

| Layer | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Cockpit checklist | `starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Step-by-step operating procedure for every session |
| Flight manual | `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` | Theory: 9 principles, 6 phases, 12 quality gates |
| Mission procedures | `workstreams/*_WORKSTREAM.md` | Domain-specific adaptations (design, architecture, development, audit, research documentation) |
| Campaign templates | `workstreams/*_CAMPAIGN.md` | Multi-session campaigns extending a workstream |

`SESSION_RUNNER.md` is the entry point — it tells agents what to read, when to stop, and how to close out. Everything cascades from that single file.

## Architecture

The framework's core loop:

```
Pre-Flight → Research → Create → Present → Implement → Verify & Close
```

Each phase is hard-gated — you cannot skip ahead. The most critical gate is between Present and Implement (no implementation without stakeholder approval).

**The compounding mechanism** is the handoff accountability loop: each session evaluates its predecessor's handoff (scored 1-10) and writes its own knowing it will be scored. This bidirectional accountability is what makes session N+1 better than session N.

### Starter Kit Files (templates for adopting projects)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `starter-kit/SESSION_RUNNER.md` | Operational checklist — users copy this to their project root |
| `starter-kit/SAFEGUARDS.md` | Commit discipline, blast radius limits, mode-switching rules |
| `starter-kit/SESSION_NOTES.md` | Empty template for session continuity between sessions |
| `starter-kit/BOOTSTRAP.md` | Step-by-step setup guide for new projects |
| `starter-kit/CHANGELOG.md` | Completed work history template — keeps BACKLOG.md lean |
| `starter-kit/ROADMAP.md` | Feature inventory and future plans template |
| `starter-kit/methodology_dashboard.py` | Health scanner — copy to project root for per-project dashboard |

### Tools

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tools/methodology_dashboard.py` | Portfolio health scanner — scores projects on activity, testing, docs, CI/CD, methodology compliance; generates HTML dashboard. Place in parent directory above project repos. Python 3 stdlib only, cross-platform. |

### Workstreams (domain-specific adaptations)

| File | Domain |
|------|--------|
| `workstreams/DESIGN_WORKSTREAM.md` | UI/UX, visual design, layout |
| `workstreams/ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM.md` | Systems, APIs, data models |
| `workstreams/DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md` | Feature implementation, bug fixes |
| `workstreams/AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` | Code audits, security reviews |
| `workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md` | Research papers, technical reports, dissertations, regulatory analyses |
| `workstreams/TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md` | Blank template for creating new workstreams |

### Campaigns (multi-session work patterns within a workstream)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` | Multi-session campaign template for exhaustive primary-source verification. Extends the Research Documentation workstream when per-session Phase 6 audit cannot complete the work. Supports both creation mode (writing) and audit mode (reviewing). |
| `workstreams/INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN.md` | Multi-session campaign template for taking over an unfamiliar codebase. Extends the Audit workstream; feeds the Development workstream via a prioritized backlog. Supports interview mode (departing owner available) and archaeology mode (owner gone). |
| `workstreams/TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN.md` | Blank template for creating new campaigns (parallel to `TEMPLATE_WORKSTREAM.md`). |

## Key Concepts to Preserve When Editing

- **SESSION_RUNNER.md documents 24 failure modes** with specific countermeasures. These are empirically derived from 60+ sessions — do not remove or weaken them without strong justification. FMs 1–23 must not be renumbered; new FMs append at the end (e.g., FM #24 was appended in v2.3, not inserted).
- **Phase 0 (Orient) must remain mandatory and blocking** — the most common failure mode is agents skipping orientation and starting work immediately.
- **"1 and done" rule** — one deliverable per session, then close out. This is structural, not advisory.
- **Ghost session detection** (Phase 0, step 5) exists because crashed sessions that leave no trace cause the next session to work from stale state.
- **Phase 1B (Claim the Session)** exists for the same reason — writing a stub before technical work ensures even crashed sessions leave evidence.
- **Minimum handoff requirements** (Phase 3D) are non-negotiable: key files with line numbers, gotchas, specific next steps. "Pick next from backlog" is explicitly insufficient.
- **Plan Mode exit trap** — Plan Mode auto-generates "Implement the following plan" as a preamble. The SESSION_RUNNER explicitly warns this does NOT mean "start coding."

## Versioning

Changes are tracked via git commits and the README's "What's New" section. Current version: v2.6. Key additions by version:

- **v1.0:** Initial 9 principles, 6 phases, 4 workstreams
- **v1.1:** Protocol erosion detection, ghost session prevention, minimum handoff requirements, 4 new failure modes (#14-17)
- **v1.2:** Planning session discipline, evidence-based inventory, phase boundaries
- **v2.0:** Methodology Dashboard — portfolio health scanner with dual-mode detection, health/risk scoring, methodology compliance checking, live HTML dashboard with auto-refresh, color-coded terminal output, starter-kit inclusion
- **v2.1:** CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md templates, three-file task tracking split, migration guide for monolithic backlogs, dashboard compliance updates, 4 new failure modes (#20-23), Artifact Integrity safeguards, build equivalent step in BOOTSTRAP, documentation project adaptations
- **v2.2:** `bin/sync` + `bin/status` distribution tooling (dual-mode commit/ignore, dual-source local/github), CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md customization seam, BOOTSTRAP.md rewrite, drift-safety guard on sync
- **v2.3:** Combined release covering two contributions. (1) **Research Documentation workstream** — adapts the methodology for research papers, technical reports, dissertations, and regulatory analyses; source-corpus management, claim-source audit pattern, 19 documented anti-patterns, toolchain adaptation table (Quarto/LaTeX/Sphinx/Pandoc/AsciiDoc/Markdown), Audit Mode for fresh-eyes review of existing repositories. (2) **SESSION_RUNNER content release** from rad-con audit (issue #6, #7) — new Phase 3E Runtime Smoke Test (renumber 3E→3F, 3F→3G), new FM #24 (build-passes-ship-it, appended — FMs 1–23 unchanged), Phase 1B "structural control" framing, Planning Sessions grep anecdote, 5 new Learnings rows.
- **v2.4:** Multi-session campaigns promoted to first-class layer — new vocabulary and document home for campaign templates that extend a workstream. New section in `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` (§Multi-Session Campaigns); new orientation step in `SESSION_RUNNER.md` (Phase 1 multi-session campaign check); new `workstreams/TEMPLATE_CAMPAIGN.md`. No principle, phase, gate, or workstream changes. Realized examples: `workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` (extends Research Documentation) and `workstreams/INHERITED_CODEBASE_FAMILIARIZATION_CAMPAIGN.md` (extends Audit).
- **v2.5:** Render-dependency completeness discipline (resolves upstream issue #12, drafted from `docs/planning/font-discipline-proposal.md`). Universal principle in `starter-kit/SAFEGUARDS.md` (new "Verify Render-Dependency Completeness" sub-section under "Verify the Build Equivalent"): build success is not asset-use success. Two-tier check: post-render is a **hard rule** (part of build-equivalent — e.g., `pdffonts` confirms all configured font faces embedded); pre-render / setup is a **soft prompt** that fires at Phase 0 when render-dep config changes (e.g., `fc-list`, `kpsewhich`). Concrete commands in `workstreams/RESEARCH_DOCUMENTATION_WORKSTREAM.md` — new Render Verification bullet, new Verification Checklist item, new "Render-Dep Check" column on the toolchain matrix (per-toolchain static + post-render commands for Quarto/LaTeX/Sphinx/Pandoc/AsciiDoc), and new anti-pattern #20 "Silent render-dependency fallback" (derived from the joy/ SBL BibLit case: 47 sessions of italic markup silently rendered as upright Latin glyphs). `workstreams/RESEARCH_EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION_CAMPAIGN.md` Render Verification section gains a render-dep completeness line so the campaign inherits the discipline. No principle, phase, gate, or workstream changes; no FM renumbering.
- **v2.6:** Skill-recommendation convention — new content layer alongside phases, principles, workstreams, and campaigns. Principle: *methodology recommends; methodology does not reimplement.* New `starter-kit/RECOMMENDED_SKILLS.md` (canonical index with per-skill known-good SHAs for external skills) + new `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` §Recommended Skills (principle paragraph + index pointer). Conceptual content distilled from the 2026-05-02 Pocock-skills audit lands as new FM #25 (horizontal slicing, appended — 1–24 unchanged), `SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 3F and `ITERATIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` Phase 6 step 8 gain an explicit "remove debug instrumentation before commit" gate (cites `/diagnose`), new `starter-kit/CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md` + Phase 2 read-step (cites `/grill-with-docs`), new Issue Lifecycle section in `DEVELOPMENT_WORKSTREAM.md` (cites `/triage`), new Debugging Sessions session type (cites `/diagnose`), new Refactor Heuristics in `ARCHITECTURE_WORKSTREAM.md` (cites Ousterhout + `/improve-codebase-architecture`), new optional Phase 2.5 Pre-Create Grill (cites `/grill-me`), pre-commit + git-guardrails paragraphs in `BOOTSTRAP.md` Step 10 (cite `/setup-pre-commit` + `/git-guardrails-claude-code`). Existing-content refactors: `SESSION_RUNNER.md` Phase 3E body shortened to cite `/verify` + `/run` (intent preserved); `AUDIT_WORKSTREAM.md` gains a Light Recommended-Skills callout citing `/code-review`, `/review`, `/security-review`. Audit doc lands at `docs/audits/2026-05-02-mattpocock-skills-evaluation.md` with a drop/keep/refactor Implementation Status header. Phase 2 step renumbered 1→2..7→8; `HOW_TO_USE.md` Phase 2 cross-references all cite by name, never by step number, so the renumber is safe. No principle, phase, gate, or workstream changes. Adopters who never use the recommended skills continue to operate the methodology as written.
