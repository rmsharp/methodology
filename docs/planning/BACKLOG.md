# Operational Backlog (fork-only) — RETIRED 2026-07-06

Operational/coordination backlog for **rmsharp's** methodology work. Fork-only — it lives in
`docs/planning/` and is **not** part of the canonical framework or any upstream PR (same convention
as [`adopter-pr25-27-remediation-plan.md`](adopter-pr25-27-remediation-plan.md)).

This was a backlog, **not** GitHub issues, by operator decision.

## Items — all complete

| Item | Scope | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **BL-1** | wsfct → v2.9 (supersede #520) | ✅ Complete in `rmsharp/wsfct` (operator). Legacy PR #520 closed. |
| **BL-2** | mts #1 — adopt PR #25/#27, refresh → v2.9 | ✅ Complete in `rmsharp/mts` (operator). |
| **BL-3** | airqino #1 — remediation + full re-vendor → v2.9 | ✅ Complete in `rmsharp/airqinodashboard` (operator). |
| **BL-4** | Housekeeping: methodology repo | ✅ DONE 2026-07-06 — plans archived to `docs/planning/`, 3 stale branches pruned, fork/upstream/tags in sync. |

**Not in this backlog:** upstream **PR #44** (REUSE compliance + license/REUSE README badges) is being
handled directly with the maintainer (Terrell) and was never a backlog item.

## Historical context (for the record)

The backlog existed to bring three v2.7-era adopter PRs (all authored 2026-06-12) current to canonical
**v2.9** before merging, and to run one methodology-repo housekeeping session. Two conventions governed it:

- **Mechanism = the documented update workflow, not PR-resurrection.** Bring an adopter current with
  `bin/status` → `bin/sync` from a canonical `methodology/` checkout (`--source=local` preferred), or the
  *"Update methodology using https://github.com/KJ5HST/methodology"* agent prompt — then supersede the
  stale PR rather than conflict-resolving it. This is exactly what v2.8's full-corpus `bin/sync`
  (`bin/_manifest.py`, issue #32) was built for.
- **Merge only when the target repo is between sessions**, since each adopter PR rewrites live operating
  files (`SESSION_RUNNER.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SAFEGUARDS.md`, `SESSION_NOTES.md`). One repo = one session.

Two adopters from the original PR #25/#27 rollout were always out of this backlog's scope:
**nprcgenekeepr** (the clean reference end-state) and **model_project_constructor** (tracked separately).
