# Handoff Receipts — durable close-out proof

The cumulative, append-only record of **each session's close-out handoff**, distilled into a
machine-checkable block. It is the durable answer to *"was close-out actually performed, and what
did the session hand its successor?"* — the part of close-out that otherwise lives only in the
transient `SESSION_NOTES.md` (overwritten every session) or the spoken report (which leaves no file
at all).

One `handoff` block per **session** (not per commit), newest on top. `bin/check-handoff` asserts each
block is present and structurally complete; the next session's Phase 0 reconcile greps this file for a
missing or still-`pending` receipt and backfills it. Together — a write-step at close-out **and** a
reconcile-on-read backstop — this makes a skipped handoff *detectable* rather than silent.

> **A green `bin/check-handoff` is not a good handoff.** The check verifies presence and structure,
> never semantic quality. Faithfulness is still scored 1–10 by the next session (Phase 3A). A
> well-formed but hollow receipt passes the check and is caught only by that human judgement.

## How to write a receipt

**At Phase 1B (claim the session)** — write the stub block below with `status: pending`, filling what
you can, and commit it with your session-claim commit. This committed `pending` block is the crash
breadcrumb: if the session ends before close-out, the next session's Phase 0 reconcile sees it.

**At Phase 3D (close-out)** — overwrite that block in place to `status: complete` and fill every
field. The block must satisfy all six Minimum Handoff Requirements (`SESSION_RUNNER.md` §3D).

## Format — a fenced `handoff` block

````
```handoff
session: S<N>
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: <pending | complete>
self_score: <1-10>
predecessor_score: <1-10>
active_task: <current state>
what_was_done: <what you did, including a commit sha — or the literal `pending`>
next_steps: <specific and actionable; never "pick next from backlog">
key_files: <each entry carries a path:line token, e.g. SessionManager.java:245>
gotchas: <traps the next session should watch for>
runtime_smoke: <a run result, or "n/a — docs-only", or "impossible: <reason>">
changelog_ref: <PR #N or a short-sha into CHANGELOG.md>
commit: <short-sha — or `pending` until the next session reconciles it>
```
<free-text prose: the durable proxy for the Phase 3G spoken report, plus the +/- self-score breakdown>

Write clean `key: value` lines — no inline `#` comments (a `#` is a literal value character,
as in `changelog_ref: PR #52`). The keys map one-to-one to the six Phase 3D Minimum Handoff
Requirements plus the two scores.
````

`self_score` and `predecessor_score` are distinct keys so one can never stand in for the other; omit
`predecessor_score` on Session 1 (there is no predecessor to score). `commit: pending` and
`what_was_done: pending` are legal at write time (the receipt ships in the very commit whose sha it
would name); the next session reconciles them to real shas.

## Three files, three questions, one shared key

- **`SESSION_NOTES.md`** — the *transient scratchpad*: rich working notes, overwritten every session.
- **`HANDOFFS.md`** (this file) — the *durable receipt*: the distilled, machine-checkable proof that
  the handoff was written, kept forever.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — the *cumulative action ledger*: *"what was done here, ever?"*, append-only.

The shared key across all three is the commit sha (`changelog_ref` / `commit` here). This file
**distills** the handoff; it does not copy the scratchpad. The belongs-here test: *would the next
session need this block to continue the work without re-reading the whole repo?*
